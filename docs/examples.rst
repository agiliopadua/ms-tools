The main functionality of `mstools` can be separated into two parts:

1. The first is for general applications. It simplifies the workflow of setting up a simulation by
manageable atom type and force field assignment, topology manipulation, trajectory reading/writing, etc...

2. The second is for high-throughput molecular simulations. It is designed for predicting liquid properties in a reproducible way.
Pre-defined simulation protocols enables fast and reliable simulation of a target molecule by automatic force field assignment,
input generation, error detection, result retrieving and post-processing.
