Simulation protocols
====================

This module provides predefined simulation protocols for performing different types of MD and QM calculations.
e.g. NPT simulation or periodic perturbation simulation with GROMACS, normal mode analysis with Gaussian, etc...
They are designed for high-throughput prediction of liquid properties.

GROMACS protocols
-----------------

To be re-implemented.
