## This is an incomplete definition for GAFF, meant for demonstration
## It covers the 35 basic atom types and 6 special atom types in GAFF
## The special atom types for conjugation and electron withdraw are not covered here
## Hybridization assignment is nasty. E.g. N in N-c1ccccc1 is SP2 hybridized, whereas P in P-c1ccccc1 is SP3 hybridized.
## N in N-C=C is considered as SP2 hybridized by RDKit, but it is not a strong planer structure.
## Therefore, hybridization is avoided if the type can be correctly assigned with other information.
